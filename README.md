# How to use

To build the executable, simply use the following command in the main directory.

```make```

This will create the executable `run` in the main directory. The input file `15_puzzles.txt` should be placed in the same directory as `run`. After placing the input file, run the following command to run the algorithm.

```./run```

After running, the output file `output.txt` will be created in the same directory as the `run` executable.

To clean up the build as well as the run output, simple use `make clean`.
